# Bachelor thesis

This is the repo for my bachelor thesis. All contents are in Estonian since the thesis is in Estonian. Ping @pearupung if anything needs translating. 

Live demo is located here: http://46.101.162.222. There is no domain name as of yet - need to hassle with Zone to make it right.




# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

Using SSH:

```
$ USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

Not using SSH:

```
$ GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> yarn deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.

### Website

This will be available as a website soon.
